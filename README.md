Check List Html page
* Html To-Do List project.
* I used inline JavaScript codes 
* Briefly you can add a new goal by typing in input area and add it to the list by push "Add" button. 
* Goals are listed and delete anyone by click on the cross which is in the same line with goal. If you check the check box that goal will be listed as a done one and goes bottom of the undone goals.
